# Pete-Alonso-Post-Game-and-Cumulative-Report

Comprehensive report that allows pitchers and coaches to see areas of strengths and weaknesses through visualizations and charts. Postgame hitting report displaying the previous game's data and a cumulative report 
on the season. Displays visualizations such as swing tendency plots, chase plots, success against speed plots, average heat maps, spray charts, and a full breakdown of where the individual has been pitched split
into pitch, count, and handedness. 

This is the R-mardown file I made to produce the PDF.
